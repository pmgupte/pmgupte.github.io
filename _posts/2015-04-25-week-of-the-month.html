<p>In my project work, I needed to find out whether the given date falls in 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th or 5th week of the given month. As usual, I googled for this solution and found many functions.<a href="http://www.hotscripts.com/forums/php/37900-week-number-month.html" rel="noreferrer">http://www.hotscripts.com/forums/php/37900-week-number-month.html</a>, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5853380/php-get-number-of-week-for-month" rel="noreferrer">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5853380/php-get-number-of-week-for-month</a> and <a href="http://mybroadband.co.za/vb/showthread.php/66311-Calculating-the-week-in-the-month-%28PHP%29" rel="noreferrer">http://mybroadband.co.za/vb/showthread.php/66311-Calculating-the-week-in-the-month-(PHP)</a> are some of them. But, being lazy, I thought those functions were too complex, and there could be a simpler solution to this. So I spent some time and came up with this function. Here is the code.</p>
