<p>Hello World!</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<p>Here with this blog post, I get started with my programming blog!! It's a well known fact that learning each programming language starts with a "hello world" program. And, so I wanted to start my programming blog with a "hello world" post. :)</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<p>Oh, what I would be blogging about? Well... I haven't decided any fix theme for this blog. And, neither I want to tie it to any particular blogging genre. So, I would definitely like to make it a mixture of how-to's, code-sharing, tips, tricks, information sharing and what not?! Most of the times I work in PHP, so, yes, most of the blog posts would be related to PHP and web-world. Apart from that, I would be blogging about web UI frameworks, web-based apps, APIs etc.</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<p>Most of the code sharing will be through gists. I am a strong believer and follower of social coding, and that's why I keep on storing (and maintaining)Â <a href="https://gist.github.com/pmgupte/">my code snippets on gist</a>/github. Feel free to follow me there as well. ;)</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<p>I hope I get plenty of time and information to share here!</p>
