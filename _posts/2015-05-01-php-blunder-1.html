<p>PHP is one of those most popular web programming languages, but it do have some serious mistakes. Here's one of them.</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<p>PHP have a predefined value 'null'. And, it can be compared with numeric values. As anybody else would, you would expect null to have a constant value, right? But that's where PHP have a problem. Look at the code below, and execute it on your system if you want to check.</p>
<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/pmgupte/8025297"></script></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The `null == 0` evaluates to true. So does `null &lt; -1`. How can some predefined value be equal to 0 and lesser than -1 at the same time?!</p>
