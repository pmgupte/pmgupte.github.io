<p>It gives me great pleasure to let you all know that, somebody have found my <a href="https://github.com/pmgupte/webmon">Webmon</a> useful! Yes, and they have <a href="https://github.com/nswebsolutions/NSWeb-Solutions-Visual-Change-tracker">forked it on github</a> and are using it in their project - of course, with due attribution.</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<p>I used it to monitor job portals and career pages of companies of my interest. I maintained it until Feb 2014. After that, it became a dormant project.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>One fine day, I was revisiting my github profile - which I do every week, as such - and found that somebody had forked out my webmon. I quickly opened their repository in other tab and started going through it. As a developer, it was so joyful for me, that my pet work is actually of help to somebody. It just made my entire day!</p>

<h2>So, what is Webmon?</h2>
<div>
<p>Webmon is a free software, written in PHP. I created it way back in 2013, with following objectives:</p>
</div>
<ol>
<li>Detect whether listed webpage have any change in contents.</li>
<li>If change is detected, calculate the difference, and output what have changed.</li>
<li>Detect both - positive and negative changes.</li>
</ol>
<div>
<p>I distributed it in the hope that it will be useful, but <u>without any warrenty</u>; without even the implied warranty of <u>merchantability</u> or <u>fitness for a particular purpose</u>. Its still available to everyone. You can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<p>I do not have any plan as of now to actively contribute to it and take it further, but I would really like if some other developer starts contributing to it, and make it a truly open source project.</p>
