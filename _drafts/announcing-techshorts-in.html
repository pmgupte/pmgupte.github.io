<p>I have created a new, hosted blog at <a href="http://techshorts.in">techshorts.in</a>. Going forward, I shall be writing all my technical articles, technical musings on that blog. however, I would continue my personal musings here. Technical posts already published here are imported on techshorts.in already, but for historic reasons those will continue to be here.</p>

<p>Why I created a separate blog for technical stuff, you ask? Well, I want to develop that site as a good stop to quickly read about tech things, and I do not wish to restrict it to only my writings. I would shortly reach out to my friends in same industry and ask them if they would like to share their thoughts/knowledge there.</p>
